WPlease is a toolkit for Wordpress development which allows to keep only specific code in a Wordpress development repository and rebuild or manipulate it quickly from a repo specific config file.

## Features

With WPlease, in one command line you can:

> Build a Wordpress working instance from scratch

> Build a preconfigured Wordpress working instance from your github repo that contains only your pecific code

> Generate a custom theme and plugin on install and auto gitignore it

> Update (add/remove) plugins and themes from the lists in wplease.json

> Add or remove a theme or a plugin from files and from wplease.json

> Wpleasify (init) an existing Wordpress project repository

> Remove all gitignored files from the project

## Getting Started

To build a Wordpress instance with WPlease, you must have a Wordpress operating environment and some additional libraries.

### Prerequisites

* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) web server
* [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) server (or MariaDB)
* [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) 5.6 or higher (7.0 recommended)
* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/)

### Caution
> For existing repos, please backup your files and database before using WPlease.

### Installing WPlease

You should install this module as a global module.

```bash
npm install -g wplease
```

### Creating new Wordpress project

Create a basic Wordpress install from scratch.
```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
wplease install
```

### WPleasify existing project

You can turn an existing Wordpress project on for WPlease. This create the required WPlease files and add existing plugins and themes to the wplease.json file.
Make sure your git repo is clean and all changes commited before using it.

```bash
cd my-project
wplease init --sync
```

You can check your wplease.json file about the plugins and themes. Then you can remove all useless files from your repository.

```bash
wplease delete
```

Then commit all changes, you're done!
```git
git add --all
git commit "Remove useless files for WPlease"
```

## Advanced usage

### Initialize your project

```bash
wplease init
```
This command suggests you to create or override thoses files into your project: 
- The `wplease.json` file to customize your Wordpress installation 
- The `.gitignore` file to ignore the whole wordpress code.
- The `.gitattributes` file.
- The `.editorconfig` file.

> **Warning:**
> Since version 1.0.10, wpleasefile.js and wpleasefile.json files became wplease.json. Please run the init script to generate the new file, then update your config.

### Customize your Wordpress config

Then edit the `wplease.json` to customize your Wordpress install.
For example, your can simply specify a custom [plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) list:
```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "config": {
    "locale": "fr_FR",
    "debug": false,
    "post_revisions": 5,
    "disable_cron": false,
    "disallow_file_edit": true
  },
  "themes": [
    "@my-project"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "wp-edit",
    "maintenance-switch",
    "@my-project"
  ],
  "options": {
    "timezone_string": "Europe/Paris",
    "show_on_front": "page",
    "page_on_front": 3
  }
}
```
> **Note:** 
> Custom themes and plugins need to be prefixed by "@". "Custom" means that the extension does not exist on the Wordpress repository. The `wplease install` command add it on theme or plugin generation but alternatively you can fill it manually in your wplease.json.

### Build Wordpress in your project

Then you can run your custom install.

```bash
wplease install
```

> **Tip:**
> You can directly add your project name to skip prompts. `wplease install my-project`

### Add or remove a Wordpress theme or plugin

You can specify a type of extension and the extension name.

```bash
wplease add plugin user-role-editor
```

```bash
wplease remove theme origin
```

> **Tip:** 
> You simply can call the short command like `wplease add` or `wplease remove` and the script ask your for the extension type and name.

### Sync your Wordpress themes and plugins

```bash
wplease sync
```

This command suggests you to synchronize your plugins and themes from your wplease.json lists.

```bash
 ? What to sync
 ❯◉ all
  ◯ plugins
  ◯ themes
```

> **Tip:**
> You can directly add the sync type to skip prompts. `wplease sync plugins`

## Script prompts

During installing, the script will ask you about several informations like the database and site creditentials. Your Wordpress instance will be quickly ready to use.

```bash
...

Defining site and admin settings...

? Site url            my-website.loc
? Site title          My Website
? Admin login         admin
